# JAM
Slam, jam, thank you ma'am.

## The Goal
Slowly creating (and probably never completing) a [SLAM](https://github.com/SilentSys/SLAM) alternative. The priority for this project is x-platform compatibility for CS:GO. I personally don't care about any of the other games SLAM supports, but I will make an effort to.

## The Plan
The plan here is to create a webserver that runs on the same machine as the game and serves a REST API. There will also be a project to build a React application to act as client, so tracks can be cued from a desktop application, your browser, the Steam overlay, or your phone.
